        <p>
            Following remarks by the rapper DaBaby regarding HIV/AIDS at a Miami, Florida festival, his remix of Dua Lipa's song Levitating has lost a significant amount of radio audience in the United States of America. Yesterday, Billboard reported that, out of all the radio plays for Levitating, DaBaby's remix now only makes up 49.5% of the radio plays for the song, a 20.7% decrease from last week. </p>

            At a performance at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami, DaBaby told an audience, "If you didn't show up today with HIV/AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that'll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cell phone light in the air", and went on to say, "Fellas, if you ain't suck a ni**a d*ck in the parking lot, put your cell phone lights in the air." Lipa responded on her Instagram story by writing that she was "surprised and horrified" by DaBaby's words, adding that "we need to come together to fight the stigma and ignorance around HIV/AIDS".
