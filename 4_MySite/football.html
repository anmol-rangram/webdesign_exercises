        <h2>How to play football</h2>
        <p>There are 2 teams. Both teams try to score more goals than their opponent. The typical time frame for a football match is 90 minutes (but this can be prolonged in some matches). There are 2 halves of each 45 minutes with a 15 minutes break in between. This break is called the half time.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A team contains 11 players. There is 1 goalkeeper and the rest 10 players are field players. One of the 11 players of a team is designed as the capitain. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to touch the ball with his hands (in his area only). The football pitch on which they play varies in size depending on the stadium but each half always mirrors the other in terms of dimensions. The only equipment needed is the football and of course a complete pitch to play on.</p>
        <p>To win, 1 team has to score more goals than their opponent. Every field player is allowed to use any body part apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. A goal counts when the ball crosses the goal line. </p>
